  		Spider-man is a fictional character, a comic book superhero that appeared in comic books published by Marvel Comics as well as the film Spider-man that was released in 2002. Spider-manâ€™s superhero quality is that he is able to cling to most surfaces and shoot spider webs using his wrist web-shooters, just like a spider. He got his power from a spider bite at a school field trip which then gave him a sixth sense that alerts him to danger and allows him to have several superhuman abilities.
